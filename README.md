# 7z-Basic-Py-Music-Bot
üçô7z Py Basic Music Bot is a Discord Basic Music bot. And Anyone Can use it! üíñ

# Basic Instructions:
‚Ä¢ For the music bot's essential operations, no additional files are required. However, you must confirm that your Python environment has the necessary dependencies installed.

‚Ä¢ You require the 'discord' package in order to access the Discord API. 'pip' can be used to install it:

- the command "**pip install discord**"

‚Ä¢ Additionally, you'll need the '**ffmpeg**' library to play music. The **discord.py[voice]**' *package, which contains the necessary dependencies for voice support, can be used instead of installing it separately:

- the command "**pip install discord.py[voice]**"

‚Ä¢ You ought should be able to successfully run the bot code after installing these dependencies. Don't forget to substitute your actual bot token from the **Discord Developer** Portal for "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN."
